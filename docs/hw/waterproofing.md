# Waterproofing (V1)

Purpose: practical choices to keep electronics dry and serviceable.

## Intended contents
- Enclosure plan (where electronics sit, cable routing, venting)
- Cable glands / strain relief / drip loops
- Conformal coating vs potting (what is acceptable, what must stay serviceable)
- Connectors (IP-rated vs internal + sealed enclosure)

## Open questions
- Target IP level vs required serviceability
- How to handle pressure equalization / condensation
- What can be coated and what must not (connectors, sensors, debug ports)
