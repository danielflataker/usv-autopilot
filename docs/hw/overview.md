# Hardware overview

This folder collects practical hardware notes for V1: power, wiring, waterproofing, and EMI/robustness.
Keep this lightweight. Update it after real bench tests and water tests.

## Pages
- Power + wiring: [wiring_power.md](wiring_power.md)
- Waterproofing: [waterproofing.md](waterproofing.md)
- EMI / noise notes: [emi_notes.md](emi_notes.md)

## TODO
- List the current V1 hardware stack (MCU, GNSS, IMU, radio, ESC, power)
- Add a simple power budget table once parts are chosen
