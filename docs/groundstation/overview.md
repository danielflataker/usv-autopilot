# Ground station overview

This folder describes the ground station used for telemetry, mission upload, and basic UI (map + plots).

V1 goal: something reliable enough for field tests, not a polished product.

## Pieces
- Backend: [backend.md](backend.md)
- Frontend: [frontend.md](frontend.md)
- Shared data model: [data_model.md](data_model.md)
- Dev setup: [dev_setup.md](dev_setup.md)

## TODO
- Decide first V1 features (map position + mode + basic commands)
- Document message flow (link to `docs/comms/telemetry.md` and `docs/comms/protocol.md`)
